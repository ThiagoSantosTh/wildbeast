  <p>This app was developed in Vue Js.</p>

  <p>
 In this project we built an awesome landing page from the beginning. 

 We started creating the Style Guide. After that, we designed the UI concept. And finally we developed a page using VueJs on the Front end.
This project consists of a listing of wolves.
